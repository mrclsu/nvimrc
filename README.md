# nvimrc

This is my Neovim config

Prerequisites:
  - [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
  - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  
After installing both, clone the repo into your ~/.config directory with the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrclsu/nvimrc ~/.config/nvim
```
 
Start neovim and run `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins used by this config.
